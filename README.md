# DACStack
A one-liner Docker deployment of everything you need to self-host your open source **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **C**ollaboration!  

## Goal:
To provide a bootstrapped platform for transparent, incentivized collaboration - thus catalyzing adoption in an entertaining fashion by mode of gamified participation - utilizing tasks and reputation.  

Within minutes your collaborative will be hosting its own open source:
* Website
* Chat
* Forum
* DevOps and Code Versioning
* Cloud Storage
* Collaborative Documents
* Project Management

... culminating into meritocratic governance! What does that even _mean_ though? Read on to get a taste...

### Brownie Points

To get things rolling, as participants cooperate to complete tasks, they can assign each other _brownie points_ that in turn represents their stake when it comes time to vote on decisions pertaining to the collaborative. A long term roadmap of the project entails developing integrations between all of the Stack's components to seemlessly assign or remove these reputational _brownie points_, relieving the responsibility from the participants and thus incrementally becoming more autonomous.

## The Stack
* DenverDAO PoA Network Node  
* [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) w/ [Colony](https://colony.io/) Reputation Apps  
* Choice of [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)/[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/)  
* Choice of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/)/[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/)  
* Choice of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)/[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

_**Disclaimer**_: The Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
