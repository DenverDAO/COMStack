Everything you need to self-host your decentralized organization's open source collaboration

## Inspiration

While the Colorado Blockchain community already has many of these services sufficiently fulfilled to some capacity, it's by majority via means of centralized providers and decision making processes that - by definition - disservices the values and principles that Colorado Blockchain was built upon.

The Stack's goal is to provide a bootstrapped platform for decentralized collaboration by mode of gamified participation, catalyzing adoption in an accessible, transparent, and entertaining fashion.

## The Stack
