# DAOStack
Everything you need to self-host your decentralized organization's open source collaboration

## Inspiration

While the Colorado Blockchain community already has many of these services sufficiently fulfilled to some capacity, it's by majority via means of centralized providers and decision making processes that - by definition - disservices the values and principles that Colorado Blockchain was built upon.

The Stack's goal is to provide a bootstrapped platform for decentralized collaboration by mode of gamified participation, catalyzing adoption in an accessible, transparent, and entertaining fashion.

## The Stack

Includes everything you need to self-host your organization's open source collaboration:  
* Private Network Node with Customized Aragon  
* Choice of NextCloud/Sandstorm  
* Choice of Matrix/Rocket.chat  
* Discourse

_**Disclaimer**_: The node in the Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
