# COMStack
A one-liner Docker deployment for everything you need to self-host an open source **C**ommunications, **O**rganizing, and **M**eritocracy stack!  

## Goal:
To provide a bootstrapped platform for transparent, incentivized collaboration that catalyzes adoption in an entertaining and accessible fashion by mode of gamified participation - focusing on tasks, skills, and reputation.  

Get to the bells and whistles you say? Within **minutes** your community will be hosting its own open source:
* DenverDAO PoA network node ([Aragon](https://aragon.org/) governance w/ [Colony](https://colony.io/) reputation apps)  
* Website (Choice of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/))  
* Chat (Choice of/bridged [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/home/)/[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/))  
* Forum ([Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/))  
* DevOps and Code Versioning ([GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/))  
* Cloud Storage and Collaborative Documents ([NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/))
* Project Management ([Taiga](https://taiga.io/))

... culminating into overflowing potential for meritocratic governance! What does that even _mean_ though, and _how_? **Read on to get a taste...**

### Brownie Points

To get things rolling: as participants cooperate to complete tasks they can assign each other _brownie points_ that - when it comes time to vote on decisions pertaining to the community - represents their weighted voting stake.  

In addition to the built in reputation system, the Stack is (by design) highly extendable and is encouraged to be augmented to mission specific requirements. [See some proposed near-future reputation apps here!](https://github.com/DenverDAO/COMStack/wiki/Proposed-Reputation-Apps)  

The roadmap that follows entails developing extensions and integrations between the Stack's components to autonomously assign or burn these reputational _brownie points_ (a machine learning bot perhaps?), relieving the responsibility from the participants while incrementally allowing the system to become more self-sustained. Also, in parallel development, the [COMStack CLI](https://github.com/DenverDAO/comstack-cli) will allow for a user-friendly and modular on-boarding experience where one can pick and choose their community's setup.

_**Disclaimer**_: The Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
