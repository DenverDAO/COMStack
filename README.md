# DACStack
Everything you need to self-host your open source **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **C**ollaboration!  

## Goal
To provide a bootstrapped platform for decentralized collaboration - catalyzing adoption in an accessible, transparent, and entertaining fashion by mode of gamified participation - utilizing tasks and reputation.  

Within minutes your collaborative will be hosting its own open source:
* Website
* Chat
* Forum
* DevOps and Code Versioning
* Cloud Storage
* Collaborative Documents
* Project Management

... all feeding into an incentivized meritocratic governance.  

As participants cooperate to complete tasks, they programmatically earn reputation points that in turn represent their weight/stake when it comes time to vote on decisions pertaining to the collaborative. A participant's reputation decays over time if a they no longer remain active.

_**Disclaimer**_: The Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
