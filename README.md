# DACStack
Everything you need to self-host your **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **C**ollaboration!

## Goal
To provide a bootstrapped platform for decentralized collaboration - catalyzing adoption in an accessible, transparent, and entertaining fashion by mode of gamified participation utilizing tasks and reputation.

## The Stack
* Private Network Node  
* ... and a choice of many public nodes  
* Aragon w/ Colony Reputation App  
* Choice of NextCloud/Sandstorm  
* Choice of Matrix/Rocket.chat  
* Choice of Drupal/WordPress  
* Discourse

_**Disclaimer**_: The node in the Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
