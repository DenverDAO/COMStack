# DACStack
Everything you need to self-host your open source **D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **C**ollaboration!  

## Goal
To provide a bootstrapped platform for decentralized collaboration - catalyzing adoption in an accessible, transparent, and entertaining fashion by mode of gamified participation - utilizing tasks and reputation.  

Within minutes your organization will be hosting its own open source:
* Website
* Chat
* Forum
* DevOps and Code Versioning
* Cloud Storage
* Collaborative Documents
* Project Management

All tied around an incentivized meritocratic governance: earning reputation (brownie points) as one participates in turn applies to said participant's weight (stake) when it comes to the decision making of the organtization.

[See some of the proposed meritocracy apps here!](https://github.com/DenverDAO/DACStack/wiki/Proposed-Meritocracy-Apps)

## The Stack
* DenverDAO PoA Network Node  
* Aragon w/ Colony Reputation App  
* Choice of NextCloud/Sandstorm  
* Choice of Matrix/Rocket.chat  
* Choice of Drupal/WordPress  
* Discourse
* GitLab
* Taiga

_**Disclaimer**_: The Stack utilizes a private Ethereum network for performance and cost purposes. As a consequence, the network functions more as a siloed simulation than "real world" application. Someday, in the not too far future, it will be possible to deploy interoperable DAO sidechains on Cosmos. For one's own DAO, in the meantime, make it real by deploying to the Ethereum mainnet!
